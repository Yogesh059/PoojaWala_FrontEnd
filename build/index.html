Pooja Wala is an innovative online platform designed to facilitate seamless booking of pandits for various ceremonies and rituals, catering to diverse linguistic preferences such as Odia, Hindi, Gujarati, and Marathi. The platform boasts a comprehensive array of over 15 distinct poojas and rituals, providing users with a rich selection to meet their spiritual needs.
      The user-friendly interface begins with a versatile signup page allowing individuals to register either as users seeking pandit services or as pandits offering their expertise. The registration process includes capturing essential details and addresses, enhancing the user and pandit profiles with comprehensive information.
      Integrated with a test API-based Stripe payment system, Pooja Wala ensures a secure and efficient transaction process for booking pandit services. Users can conveniently select a date and choose from a variety of ceremonies, streamlining the entire booking experience.
      The platform leverages the MERN stack, incorporating MongoDB as the database solution. Four distinct collections within MongoDB manage user data, pandit details, and product information, with the latter specifically catering to the addition of poojas directly from the database, eliminating the need for manual coding.
